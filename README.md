Requirements

<!-- Front-end -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Build a homepage that shows product images, titles, and prices -->
<!-- Each item should have an Add to Cart button -->
<!-- There should be a navigation bar with a cart icon -->
<!-- The cart icon should update based on how many items are in it (ie 3, 5, 10) -->

Menu item for Login/Signup
User can sign up and log in

<!-- Each item should have a details page that has an Image, Title, Description, and price. A user can add to the cart as well as change the quantity. -->

All images in this project should be cached locally so they aren't downloaded each time

<!-- Back-end -->
<!-- For the backend, you will use the open-source Node API CommerceJS -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Get started HERE (Follow the 3 steps in Account Setup)
From your Dashboard you will need to:
1). Create 5 different product categories
2). Create 5 different products in each of those categories
Each product needs an image, title, description, quantity and price
Note: You are using this pre-built back-end API to give your front-end the data you need. You should not have to write any backend code. -->

<!-- Full-Stack -->
<!--  -->
<!--
You must get your front-end to "talk" to the CommerceJS API. This means downloading products, parsing the JSON, and then showing that UI in the app
You CANNOT use their SDK or CDN. You must use a standard HTTP library such as Fetch or Axios and you must parse the JSON yourself. All http request examples can be found in the documentation.
Use Postman or similar tool to test API calls are working. -->

<!-- End result: A user should be able to use your front end just as they might use Amazon.com. i.e.: -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Display items -->
<!-- Sort by category -->

Product search

<!-- Add items to cart -->
<!-- Update cart item quantity -->
<!-- Remove items from cart -->

Proceed to checkout (price summary + tax zone rate (available through the API).
http and UI error handling. (i.e. UI handling for: user entered quantity that exceeds quantity in DB. Products failed to load. Error adding item to cart, etc)

<!-- All API actions are found in the CommerceJS API documentation and the data is saved on the backend. -->
